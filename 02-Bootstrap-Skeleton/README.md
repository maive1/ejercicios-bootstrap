# `02` Bootstrap Skeleton

If you want to import Bootstrap to your website, you can use this public URL that is available to everybody:

```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
	integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous" />

```


When using Bootstrap, you have to wrap all of your content within the following **container** classes:

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```
OR
```html
<div class="container-fluid"></div>
```


## 📝 Instructions:


1. Link the Bootstrap CSS Stylesheet with the document using the **link** tag you find above.
2. Wrap the content of the website within a div with a **container** class.
3. **Build** and then **Preview** the exercise and compare the differences.
4. Now change the class of the div you've just created to **container-fluid**.
5. **Build** and then **Preview** again and compare the differences.


## 💡Hint:

To understand the difference between both **container** classes, you have to make the div container (the blue one, on the bottom left of the screen) bigger.
